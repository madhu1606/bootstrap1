      <p class="p-2 font-italic">This article is about the general concept of art.
         For the group of creative disciplines, see The arts. 
         For other uses, see Art (disambiguation).
         Art is a diverse range of (and products of) human activities involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency,
          beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.[1][2][3]

      <p>There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art,<br> and ideas have changed over time. The three classical<br>
         branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.<br> Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media<br>
          such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.[1][8] Until the 17th century, art referred to any <br>skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences.<br>
           In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and<br> distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>

    <p>The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation,<br>
       are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.<br> The resulting artworks are studied in <br>
      the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.</p>
